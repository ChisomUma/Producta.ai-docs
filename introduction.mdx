## What is Producta?

Producta is a development platform that automates technical ticket resolution and code generation.
It integrates with Linear and GitHub, enabling teams to assign tickets for AI-driven clarification, planning, and implementation, resulting in ready-to-review pull requests.
This reduces manual coding tasks and lets developers focus on complex challenges.
Producta also helps transform high-level ideas into well-defined technical tasks, improving clarity and collaboration in development teams.

## Why Producta?

AI has come to stay, and new AI tools are being created daily to improve workflows. Research has shown that 92% of U.S. developers use AI coding tools at work (GitHub, 2023).
The problem is that while LLMs can handle tasks from fixing UI bugs to optimizing SQL queries, they sometimes produce misleading or incorrect results, wasting developer time.

Producta addresses this by integrating AI directly with your issue tracker. This approach helps create clear, concise tickets with proper context, generating more accurate code solutions while minimizing developer effort.
