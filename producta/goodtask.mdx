Producta can either be used to solve tickets or refine them.&#x20;

Below are some general tips on defining tasks to get the best results.

## Solving Tasks

Let’s start with this simple task about adding some tests, which we want Producta to directly solve, and see how we can improve it to obtain better results:

### Tips for Improvement

* Be Clear: state the problem or solution at hand. Focus on making it clear and straightforward.

* Point at the relevant code: if you are defining a technical solution, be as specific as you can about which files, classes, or functions need to be updated:

## Refine Tasks

Now let’s discuss how to better create tickets defining ideas or projects that we want Producta to help us refine into technical tasks. Consider this vague task about creating an integration with Linear:

### Tips for improvement&#x20;

* Be elaborate: explain the idea or project's purpose, features, and use.

* **Iterate**: the best way to refine a large task is to divide it into smaller, more precise tasks. When Producta’s AI recommends this, you can create new tasks and refining them using Producta.
