## How to use Producta

<Tip>
  If you haven't signed up your Producta account, read this documentation to get started.
</Tip>

To work on a task with Producta, move it into the `Producta: to do` state. Producta's AI creates solutions right away if your task is clearly defined. If your request is vague, it helps break it down into specific, actionable tasks.

### Here is how it works

<Accordion title="If the task needs refinement:" defaultOpen={false}>
  A comment will be left on the task, guiding you on how to refine and clarify the task. Update the task description for Producta to check again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If the task is clear ready" defaultOpen={false}>
  Producta’s AI will generate code to solve the task. When the code is validated, a pull request will be opened and the task will be moved into the `Producta: in review` state.
</Accordion>
